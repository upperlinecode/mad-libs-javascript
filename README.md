## Intro

This lab will give you practice with variables, console.log, user input and concatenation. The javascript function `console.log` allows us to easily display pre-written messages. By adding variables, we're able alter parts of those messages without changing the core of our code. We've seen how variables can be concatenated with strings to make custom messages. In this lab, you will be creating a Mad Libs game to get more comfortable with concatenation and have some fun!

<summary> If you've never played Mad Libs before, here's how it generally works.</summary>
One person holds a story that contains blanks, each with a suitable part of speech written under it (verb, adverb, noun, adjective etc.). They ask a friend to supply them with words that match each parts of speech, without letting that friend see the story, writing the words onto the blanks as they go. When they get to the end, they read their ridiculous creation aloud.
